BATTLES:

GoPAL_SET (3def)
	Calls 1c:5ddf.

DeterminePaletteID (1c:5f97)
	Calls GoPAL_SET through Predef. Something's fishy?

1c:5ddf:
	Called from GoPAL_SET. calls DeterminePaletteID, then apparently sets the palettes.
	
f:6fb8: battle initialization function.

1c:5ddf: Essentially GoPAL_SET.
	It accepts a "command" in b. It jumps to index b in a table at 5F73. Values:
		00 = Set black palettes at beginning of battle
		01 = Set proper palettes for pokemon/trainers in battle
		02 = Map
		03 = Pokemon status
		04 = Show pokedex data
		06 = Set titlescreen palettes
		07 = Called before intro
		08 = Open pokedex (just clear it)
		09 = Load maps
		0A = Sets pokemon menu
		0D = Trainer card
		FC = Called 6 times when loading pokemon menu: status bars
		FF = Use code [cf1c] instead. Useful for reloading after a menu clears something.

1c:5fb6: For code FC. Determines lifebar color and displays it.

1c:616d: Unused GBC Code?

0f:60df: function where lifebar is moved down. Returns when finished.
03:7a1d Function where lifebar is decreased.

TODO

- Change box: pokeball colors
- Intro colors
- Attacks
- Dynamic lifebar colors
