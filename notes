BATTLES:

GoPAL_SET (3def)
	In the grand scheme it looks like it simply invokes a PAL_SET sgb command.
	Calls 1c:5ddf.

DeterminePaletteID (1c:5f97)
	Calls GoPAL_SET through Predef. Something's fishy?

1c:5ddf:
	Called from GoPAL_SET. calls DeterminePaletteID, then apparently sets the palettes.
	
f:6feb: called when battle is started; sets black palette

f:6fb8: battle initialization function.

1c:616d: UNUSED GBC CODE???
